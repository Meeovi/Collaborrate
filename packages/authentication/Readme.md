## AlternateCMS Authentication

### Currently there are 22 pre-installed authentication strategies using Passport.js

### Files to know are:

1. index.js is the main Authentication file
2. package.json is where packages are installed
3. /api folder is for api creation and management for authentication
4. /routes defines how authentication routes are done in AlternateCMS

# Do Not Remove this folder as it will remove authentication in AlternateCMS
